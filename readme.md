# ST Doodle Draw 

## Welcome Message
Welcome to Sir Trixalot's Doodle Draw Component. It is a Blazor canvas drawing component with some flexibility on styling, theming and configuration.

This plugin was inspired by all the Angular npm packages that are so freely available for quick starts and not so much for Blazor. Additionally, since 
the .net5 release I have been burning to try it out. So this is my attempt at a contribution to the community and I really hope you find it usefull and saves you some time.

Check out the documentation and a live [demo](https://trevormare.github.io/STDoodle) here. TBC

## Important Notes
This plugin relies on .net5 and can be ported if you want. The whole idea for me regarding this project was to spend some time on the framework. It might also not have all the features of one of the existing packages but I'm pretty sure it can be extended to do what you want. Another thing I wanted to try was to use the minimum javascript to see how far I can push Blazor.

# Roll your own
## Build Requirements
To build this project you need to have Satan's tool installed (NodeJs) as this is used for some of the dependencies that's included in the project.

# TLDR

## Usage
### Register the service in Startup.cs (Server Side)

```c
    using Doodle;
    ...
    ...
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
      ...
      services.UseDoodle((config) => 
      {
        config.DefaultStrokeColor = "#FF0000";
        config.DefaultStrokeSize = 2;
        ...
      });
      ...
    }
```
### Register the service in Startup.cs (WASM)

```c
    using Doodle;
    ...
    ...
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
        builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");

        builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
        builder.Services.UseDoodle((config) => 
        {
            config.DefaultStrokeColor = "#FF0000";
            config.DefaultStrokeSize = 2;
            ...
        });


        await builder.Build().RunAsync();
    }
```

### Create a Doodle
  
The tour can be included in a separate Razor Component or on the page.

```html
    @using Doodle.Components

    <div style="height: 50vh;">
        <DoodleDraw @ref="_doodleDraw">
            
        </DoodleDraw>
    </div>

    @code {
    private DoodleDraw _doodleDraw;

    private string _jsonData;

    private async Task RenderTest() 
    {
        await _doodleDraw.ExportDoodleToImage();
    }

    private async Task SaveTest()
    {
        _jsonData = await _doodleDraw.SaveCurrentDrawState();
    }

    public async Task RestoreTest()
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_jsonData))
        {
            await _doodleDraw.RestoreCurrentDrawState(_jsonData);
        }
    }

}
```
